# Welcome to OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation hub! This central resource provides comprehensive guidance on our project management processes, methodologies, and best practices. Whether you're a new team member getting up to speed or an experienced contributor looking for specific process information, you'll find everything you need to successfully navigate and contribute to OctoAcme projects.

## Project Management Processes Overview

**OctoAcme operates on a customer-first, iterative delivery framework** guided by five core principles: prioritizing customer value and usability, delivering small testable increments, establishing clear ownership through named Project Managers and Product Leads, making data-informed decisions based on measured impact, and fostering psychological safety that encourages feedback and learning. The organization follows a structured five-phase lifecycle that progresses from **Initiation** (defining problem statements, stakeholders, and high-level timelines with a Project One-pager), through **Planning** (breaking work into shippable increments with acceptance criteria, estimating scope, and identifying dependencies), **Execution** (building, testing, reviewing, and iterating), **Release** (deploying, verifying, and announcing with standardized checklists for patch, minor, and major releases), and finally **Close & Retrospective** (capturing learnings and converting them into actionable improvements).

**The team structure centers on three clearly defined personas:** Developers design, build, and test software components while participating in code reviews and identifying technical risks. Product Managers define what should be built by owning the product vision, prioritizing the roadmap and backlog, and validating solutions through user research and metrics. Project Managers coordinate all delivery activities by managing risks, dependencies, facilitating meetings, and ensuring consistent documentation across stakeholders.

**Communication strategies emphasize regularity, transparency, and a single source of truth.** OctoAcme maintains a structured communication cadence including weekly syncs between PM and Product Manager, twice-weekly standups for delivery teams, monthly stakeholder updates, and ad-hoc escalations as needed. Risk management follows a defined lifecycle where risks are identified, assessed, mitigated, and monitored with clear escalation paths.

**Quality assurance is integrated throughout the delivery process** with Definition of Done established during planning, rigorous quality gates before production deployment, and timeboxed retrospectives after each sprint, release, or incident to capture learnings and drive continuous improvement.
