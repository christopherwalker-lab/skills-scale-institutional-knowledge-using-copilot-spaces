## Stakeholder Communication Best Practices

### Frequency Guidelines
- **Weekly:** For high-priority or at-risk projects
- **Bi-weekly:** For active projects in execution phase
- **Monthly:** For stable projects or long-term initiatives
- **Ad-hoc:** For critical issues, scope changes, or escalations

### Audience Tailoring
- **Executive Leadership:** Focus on executive summary, health dashboard, and decisions needed
- **Product Team:** Emphasize progress, metrics, and upcoming priorities
- **Engineering Teams:** Highlight dependencies, technical risks, and resource needs
- **Cross-functional Partners:** Focus on dependencies and collaboration points

### Communication Channels
- **Email:** For formal updates and record-keeping
- **Slack/Teams:** For quick status and informal updates
- **Meetings:** For complex discussions or decision-making
- **Dashboard/Portal:** For self-service real-time status

### Writing Tips
- **Be Concise:** Use bullet points and tables for scannability
- **Be Honest:** Don't hide problems; escalate early
- **Be Visual:** Use status indicators (🟢🟡🔴) and trend arrows (↗️➡️↘️)
- **Be Actionable:** Clearly state what you need from stakeholders
- **Be Consistent:** Use same format and schedule for predictability

### Distribution Strategy
- **To:** Primary stakeholders and decision-makers
- **CC:** Extended team members and interested parties
- **BCC:** (Generally avoid; use distribution lists instead)
- **Archive:** Store in shared location accessible to all team members
