# Risk Escalation Checklist

## Purpose
Ensure risks are escalated appropriately with complete information and clear expectations for resolution.

## When to Use
Use this checklist when a risk needs escalation beyond the team level, particularly when:
- Blocker unresolved after 2 business days
- Risk impact upgraded to High
- Dependency on external team not responding
- Budget or timeline variance >20%
- Security or compliance concerns identified

## Pre-Escalation Preparation

### 1. Document the Risk
- [ ] Risk is logged in the Risk Register with unique ID
- [ ] Description clearly explains the issue and context
- [ ] Impact assessment completed (High/Medium/Low)
- [ ] Likelihood assessment completed (High/Medium/Low)
- [ ] Risk owner assigned
- [ ] Current status documented

### 2. Demonstrate Resolution Attempts
- [ ] List actions already taken to mitigate or resolve
- [ ] Document why team-level resolution was insufficient
- [ ] Identify what additional authority, resources, or decisions are needed
- [ ] Note any time-sensitive constraints

### 3. Quantify Impact
- [ ] Timeline impact: days/weeks of delay
- [ ] Budget impact: additional cost or resource needs
- [ ] Customer impact: affected users, features, or commitments
- [ ] Business impact: revenue, reputation, or strategic implications

## Escalation Execution

### 4. Choose the Right Level
- [ ] **Team-level** (if not already attempted): Daily standup discussion
- [ ] **PM-level**: Cross-team coordination, resource reallocation
- [ ] **Product Lead**: Strategic decisions, priority changes
- [ ] **Sponsor**: Executive decision, budget/timeline changes, business impact

### 5. Prepare Escalation Communication
- [ ] Subject line clearly indicates urgency and topic
- [ ] Summary of the risk in 2-3 sentences
- [ ] Link to detailed documentation (Risk Register entry, issue, etc.)
- [ ] Specific ask or decision needed
- [ ] Proposed options or recommendations
- [ ] Response deadline appropriate to urgency

### 6. Execute Escalation
- [ ] Send escalation to appropriate stakeholder(s)
- [ ] CC relevant team members and PM
- [ ] Schedule meeting if synchronous discussion needed
- [ ] Set calendar reminder for follow-up if no response by deadline

## Post-Escalation

### 7. Track and Communicate
- [ ] Document decision or outcome in Risk Register
- [ ] Update risk status (escalated, mitigated, accepted, etc.)
- [ ] Communicate resolution back to team
- [ ] Update project timeline or plan if needed
- [ ] Add to next status update for transparency

### 8. Learn and Improve
- [ ] Note escalation in retrospective for process improvement
- [ ] If escalation revealed process gap, document for future
- [ ] Update risk mitigation strategies based on outcome

## Tips for Effective Escalation

- **Be Clear**: State the problem and ask explicitly, avoid ambiguity
- **Be Concise**: Executives need TL;DR - details in linked docs
- **Be Timely**: Don't wait until it's too late to course-correct
- **Be Solution-Oriented**: Bring options, not just problems
- **Be Professional**: Escalation is not blame, it's problem-solving
- **Follow Through**: Ensure decisions are implemented and communicated
