# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

## Tracking Improvements
Action items from retrospectives should feed back into our processes and documentation:

### Action Item Management
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Tag action items with `retrospective-action` or similar label for tracking
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
- Update relevant process documents when improvements are validated

### Feedback Loop to Process Documentation
When retrospective action items reveal process gaps or improvements:
1. **Identify**: Note which process area is affected (planning, execution, release, etc.)
2. **Validate**: Test the improvement in 1-2 sprints or projects
3. **Document**: Update the relevant process doc in `docs/` folder
4. **Communicate**: Share the improvement in team sync and update stakeholders
5. **Measure**: Track adoption and impact of the change

### Examples of Process Improvements
- Retrospective reveals unclear DoD → Update planning doc with better DoD template
- Post-incident retro identifies communication gap → Enhance incident template in risks doc
- Sprint retro shows estimation issues → Add estimation guide to planning doc

This creates a continuous improvement cycle where learnings become institutional knowledge.

## Continuous Improvement Culture
Foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement:

### Principles
- **Measure Impact**: Track metrics before and after implementing action items
- **Celebrate Wins**: Recognize teams and individuals who drive improvements
- **Iterate Small**: Make small, testable changes rather than large process overhauls
- **Share Learnings**: Document successful improvements in process docs for reuse
- **Psychological Safety**: Encourage honest feedback without blame

### Measuring Action Item Impact
Track and report on improvement outcomes:
- Cycle time reductions
- Defect rate changes
- Team satisfaction scores
- Deployment frequency improvements
- Time saved through process refinements

### Knowledge Sharing
- Update process documentation when validated improvements emerge
- Share retrospective insights in monthly all-hands or team newsletters
- Create case studies for significant process improvements
- Contribute learnings back to the institutional knowledge base
